=== Configure Sandbox

Before you can configure the Sandbox, you will need to edit your hosts file to make sure that you can access the sandbox through your browser. You will need root or admin permissions to change these files.

- **Linux:** Add the line `127.0.0.1  sandbox.hortonworks.com` to the `/etc/hosts` file

- **Mac:** Add the line `127.0.0.1  sandbox.hortonworks.com` to the `/private/etc/hosts` file

- **Windows:** Add the line `127.0.0.1  sandbox.hortonworks.com` to the `C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts` file

[NOTE]
====
Make sure that you save `hosts` as type "all files" and not as a .txt file. That should be how it appears in the /etc/ folder.
